# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Stacked-LSTM

In this project, we try to predict the stock market trend using the historic data available. 
The method used in the project is the stacked LSTM approch.

This is only a sample project. Please do not use this code on real life scenarios of stock market investment.

Also, please be noted that being a beginner, I had taken assistance from various sources like online video tutorials, github profiles, etc on preparing this project and hence, you might find similar code snippets from other sources as well.
